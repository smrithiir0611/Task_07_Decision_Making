# Stakeholder Report – WNBA Data Insights (2018–2022)

## Overview
This report summarizes the main findings from the WNBA team performance analysis between 2018 and 2022. The goal was to turn statistical patterns into insights that can guide coaching and management decisions.

## Key Insights
- **Most Improved Teams:** Chicago Sky showed the greatest improvement, increasing win % from 38.2 to 72.2.  
- **Top Performers:** Connecticut Sun and Seattle Storm led with 105 total wins each, followed by Las Vegas Aces (103).  
- **Winning Factors:** The strongest positive correlation with win % was total wins (r = 0.90). Field-goal % and points per game were also strong contributors.  
- **Challenges:** High turnovers (r = –0.34) and personal fouls (r = –0.60) showed negative correlations with success.

## Ethical and Practical Takeaways
These results are descriptive, not causal. Coaches and analysts should use them as supporting evidence when forming strategies. The analysis also highlights the importance of reviewing data fairness, ensuring that context such as player workload or roster stability is not ignored.

## Next Steps
- Apply similar analysis to individual player stats for deeper insights.  
- Monitor performance trends over time to identify consistency or decline.  
- Use AI tools carefully — as assistants for pattern detection, not as final authorities.
