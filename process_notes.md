This task continued from my earlier WNBA data analysis. I began by reviewing the previous LLM-generated interview and identifying areas that could be expanded into an actionable decision report.

I recreated the same descriptive statistics in Python, verified the numbers, and added a correlation plot for better visualization. I also made sure all scripts were reproducible and well-documented.

Then I worked on the stakeholder report by rephrasing the AI insights in a way that a coach or manager could use. I made sure to include ethical notes, uncertainty, and fairness points to show limitations.

Finally, I reflected on how AI can support decision-making but still needs human validation, especially in data-driven contexts like sports.
